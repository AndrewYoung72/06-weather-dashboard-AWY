## Purpose

For this assignment we are asked to build a weather dashboard utilizing server side APIs. The user should be able to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, which are stored to the side in a search history. When presented with the city of choice the user should see the date with an iconic representation of the weather and a UV index. The UV index should indicate by color wether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. When the user clicks on a city in the search history then the stored five day forecast for that city should be presented.
